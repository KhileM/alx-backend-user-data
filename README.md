Backend user data refers to the information collected, stored, and managed by the server-side components of a software application or system. This data typically includes details about users, such as usernames, passwords, email addresses, preferences, activity logs, and any other relevant information required for the functionality and security of the application. Backend systems handle the processing, storage, and retrieval of this data, ensuring its integrity, security, and availability to support the functionality of the application's frontend and user interactions.
