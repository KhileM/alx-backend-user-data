Basic authorization is a simple method used in software development to control access to resources or functionalities. It involves sending a username and password with each request to the server. The server then verifies these credentials against its database and grants access if they are valid. Basic authorization is typically implemented using the HTTP protocol's `Authorization` header, where the credentials are encoded in Base64 format. However, it's important to note that Basic authorization is considered less secure compared to other methods like OAuth due to its vulnerability to interception and replay attacks, especially when used over unencrypted connections.
